Re-doing website 
It is currently really inefficient 

Why images matter
-size matters

Avg web page is 3mb

go into the images and see the sizes - sort by that

When you first load the page go to the Network tab and refresh the page

by the online/offline bar you can select slow 3g 


jpeg is great for like pictures of the woods images with lots of color can't deal with hard transitons
PNG hard edges and supports transperancy
SVG just uses math! great for icons and simple stuff
GIF - Useless!

general compression!!
	- Lossless compression
	- GULP-IMAGEMIN in our circus starter is already stripping stuff for us
	-imageoptim for Mac

Tools Adjust size 
and can crop too just on the image parts Hit command k to get it sized down

JPG save for web on photoshop you can adjust the quality slider and see the estimated size

PNG PNGquant can compress them for you imageAlpha is a fav - You can reduce the number of colors it can use to reduce it
